OpenFlow-Flight-Recorder
========================

As its name implies OPFR records all OpenFlow packets between the controller and the switches it is controlling.  Its primary purpose is to provide a trouble shooting aid for software developers and hardware (switch) vendors to troubleshoot and debug OpenFlow based events.
